# PlaylistProcessor

Processes playlists from Youtube and Vimeo saved as files into markdown lists

Save html/txt files in the content folder.
Save markdown lists (*.md) of existing links in the existing folder.

Run the cleanuplist.py to process html files.
Run the cleanupvimeo.py to process txt files.

Used to work out what has changed in my playlists in comparison with videos to watch/videos I've enjoyed lists.

Very much WiP!
